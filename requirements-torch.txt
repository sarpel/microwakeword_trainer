# microwakeword_trainer - PyTorch Environment Requirements
# Version 2.0 - For Speaker Clustering and SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN Embeddings
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a SEPARATE environment from the TensorFlow training environment.
# TensorFlow and PyTorch conflict - do NOT install them together.
#
# Use this environment ONLY for:
# - Speaker clustering with SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN embeddings
# - Hard negative mining with speechbrain
# - Data preprocessing with transformers
#
# For the main training pipeline, use requirements.txt (TensorFlow environment).
